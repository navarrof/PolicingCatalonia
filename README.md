### A quick overview: 



Catalonia is an autonomous community of Spain. It lies in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, to the south of the Pyrenees mountain range. The capital and largest city, Barcelona, is the second-most populated municipality in Spain and the fifth-most populous urban area in the European Union. The Mossos dâ€™Escuadra is the police force of Catalonia, responsible for law enforcement in this autonomous area.
